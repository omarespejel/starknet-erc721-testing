# Starknet Workshop: Testing with Protostar 

Code for the StarkNet Workshop #4: Testing with Protostar. The recording is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3duFa_5Zq6A) (the video starts without sound) and here are the [slides](./slides_Protostar_testing_workshop.pdf).


During this workshop we:
1. Deploy a custom ERC721 contract to the testnet using Protostar. The contract allows us to mint animals with characteristics such as wings, legs and sex. This contract is inspired by the [starknet edu automated workshop](https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc721).
2. Learn about Protostar cheatcodes, inspired by Foundry, to test and deploy locally.
3. Create unit and integration tests for our custom ERC721 contract. We deploy locally using Protostar and test using Cairo and hints.
